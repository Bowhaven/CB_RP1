# CB_RP1
Research project 1 - Supplementary material

Included in this repository is a Python script containing all of the data preparation and analysis.

The script is divided into sub-sections for each of the following tasks in order:
      - Import of external packages
      - Specification of input file pathways
      - Reading in of yield data
      - Calculation of temporal yield stability values
      - Creation of yield over time graphs
      - Calculation of species richness
      - Calculation of Shannon Diversity Index values
      - Calculation of species evenness
      - Correlation testing between all variables
      - Linear regression testing and plotting
      - Five-way ANOVA testing (including data standardization)
      - Creation of histogram and boxplot charts
      - Linear regression testing and plotting in a more efficient format
      - Additional work that was not used in the final dissertation:
            - Considering the difference in the relationship between diversity and temporal stability at different nutrient levels
            - PCA analysis and plotting
            - Plotting mean yield over time for each treatment and an overall mean
            - Plotting a running mean temporal stability value over time
